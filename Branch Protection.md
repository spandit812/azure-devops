**Brach protection:**  

If you want to protect your **main** branch, Go to main branch and add branch policy.   

1. To protect the branch, we go into the **Branch->Branch Policy** and set Pull request, reviewer.  

2. You can **link work item** as well in the branch policy, which restricts the developers and asks to add workitme with the pull request.
